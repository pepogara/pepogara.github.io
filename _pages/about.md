Hi, I’m **Felipe Garavelli**, an engineering physics student at UBC with a background in robotics and applied physics.  
I’m interested in robotics, optics, data-driven decision making, and energy. I enjoy building systems that combine hardware, software, and theory.  

On this website, you’ll find:
- **Projects** I’ve worked on (engineering, research, and personal)  
- **Experiences** from working in industry  
- **Courses** I’ve taken that shaped my research interests
