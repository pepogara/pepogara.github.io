I'm in my 5th year of [engineering physics at UBC](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/), where I have built a strong foundation in both robotics and applied physics. Our coursework consists of both theoretical classes as well as year-long project-based ones. This mix has given me experience with control systems, prototyping, sensors, experimental design, and machine learning.

In 2024 I went on exchange to [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html) where I took advanced master's-level courses in areas such as plannig and decision making for autonomous robots, aerodynamics, photonics, and various others.

I’m particularly interested in robotics, optics, energy systems, and data-driven decision making. I enjoy building systems that integrate hardware, software, and theory. Whether I’m prototyping a robotic mechanism, optimizing an optical system, or developing a control strategy, I’m motivated by projects that connect concepts with practical applications.
